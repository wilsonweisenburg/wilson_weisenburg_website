    <p class="p_all">I have a lot of activities and hobbies I enjoy to do regularly. Some of my hobbies include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Listening to music</li>
        <li>Keeping up with MLB updates</li>
        <li>Playing video games, on console or computer</li>
        <li>Swimming</li>
        <li>Sailing a boat called Lasers, when I have the chance</li>
        <li>Hanging out with friends and girlfriend</li>
        <li>Vibin'</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Sports</h1>

    <p class="p_all">During the school year, I play water polo in the fall, and I swim for the swim team in the spring. Water polo is a competitive, tough sport that I have become a much better person and athlete out of playing for four years. Swimming is all about self-improvment for the strong-willed. Water polo players are sort of mandated to swim in the spring to keep active and to stay in the shape going into the summer. The swim team compliments water polo players immensely.</p>
