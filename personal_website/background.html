    <h1 class="header">Background Information</h1>

    <p class="p_all">My name is Wilson Weisenburg; I have been a Bay Area native all my life. My family consists of my brother, my sister, mom and dad. I was born in Santa Rosa on August 11, 2002, late at night I think. In some free time I had I tried to uncover the roots of my family and where everyone is from. My dad's great-grandparents came from Austria sometime in the 19th century. My mom's mom immigrated from Mexico almost seventy years ago. Though I am not familiar with any family I have in Mexico or may have in Austria.</p>

    <h1>Interesting Story</h1>

    <p class="p_all">I have a rather bad memory of things that have happened to me, but I do remember a little tid bit from my childhood. I was on vacation in Mexico, where my family owns a condo inside of a resort area that's not too tourist-y. The resort was having a grand opening of it's new golf course marked for golfer Gary Player, and I was there watching him do a practice round. After he completed a hole, we were allowed to rush towards the golf balls that me and my brother later got autographed. After the practice round was over, Gary Player started his real run through of the course. I didn't know that it was for real, so I mistakenly went to go pick up a golf ball. My mom was a tad embarrassed as my dad was chuckling when he told me to swap the practice ball for the golf ball I picked up. Gary Player didn't have a bright expression on his face during this incident of mine.</p>
